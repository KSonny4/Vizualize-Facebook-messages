# Vizualize-Facebook-messages
Vizualize frequent words from your Facebook messages using wordcloud where the messages are imported from JSON generated by Facebook.

Simply change the path to your json file with messages in variable "json_file" and run the algorithm.
This implementation is dealing specifically with badly encoded JSON provided by Facebook. The original data is UTF-8 encoded but was decoded as Latin-1 instead. So other languages can have similiar problem.

This is the result (1 surname and 2 offensive words were deleted) of our communication with my CVUT FEL classmates. This result was made from over 250 K messages.
